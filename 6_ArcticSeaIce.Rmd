# Exercise IV: Arctic Sea Ice?

## Skills: read data, plot, save figure, for loops, subsetting, boolean logic, install package (lubridate), 

- <http://nsidc.org/data/G02135>
- <ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/N_seaice_extent_daily_v3.0.csv>


## Question 1:

- Describe the data set: what are the columns and units? 
- Where do these data come from? 
- What is the uncertainty in measurement? Resolution of the data? Interpretation of missing values?


## Question 2:

Construct the necessary R code to import this data set as a tidy `Table` object.

## Question 3:

Plot the data and describe the trends you observe.    
```{r}
# arctic_ice = read.csv("data/N_seaice_extent_daily_v3.0.csv", skip=2, header = FALSE, col.names = c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Extent", "Missing", "Source_Data"))
url = 'ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/N_seaice_extent_daily_v3.0.csv'
arctic_ice = read.delim(url, skip=2, sep=",", header=FALSE, col.names = c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Extent", "Missing", "Source_Data"))
head(arctic_ice)
```
Notice that unlike in previous data sets, the date information is split into three columns: year, month, day. This will make it harder to plot a time series since we can only plot one variable along the x axis. We could do the math to turn the month and day variables into decimal dates. Another, simpler, option is to take advantage of the `lubridate` package that was designed by other R users. Installing, loading and using functions from R packages can save you loads of time and dramatically increase the functionality of the R language. We will use many other packages throughout the course.

First, we need to install the lubridate package from the CRAN library. You can do this in RStudio using the top menu: `Tools -> Install packages...`. Then type the name of the package you want (lubridate) into the text box, make sure the `Install Dependencies` box is checked and click `Install`. Or you can simply do it at your command line with the function `install.packages("lubridate")`. Once installed, you need to load the package functions into your environment with the `library()` function. Now that the `lubridate` package is loaded up, we can use the function `make_date()` to transform your year, month and date into a `date` type variable. Don't forget you can use the command `?make_date` to find out more about the function (or just search for the function in the Help tab of the lower left panel in RStudio).

```{r}
# install.packages("lubridate")
library("lubridate")  # make_date()

arctic_ice$date = make_date(arctic_ice$Year, arctic_ice$Month, arctic_ice$Day)
plot(Extent ~ date, data=arctic_ice, ylab="Arctic sea ice extent (x10^6 km^2)", type='l') 
```
Use for loops to calculate the annual average Arctic sea ice extent and the 5-year-average Arctic sea ice extent. The annual average is the mean of all of the sea ice extent observations within a given year. We'll define the 5-year-average ice extent for a given year x as the mean of all sea ice exten observations within the year x as well as the 2 years prior and the 2 years after year x. For example, the 5-year-average sea ice extent for 2010 is the mean of all observations from Jan. 1 2008 to Dec. 31 2012.

```{r}
arctic_ice_annual = data.frame(Year=seq(min(arctic_ice$Year), max(arctic_ice$Year)), extent_annual_avg=NA, extent_5yr_avg=NA)
head(arctic_ice_annual)
# Hard-coding the years
# calculate annual average:
for (i in seq(dim(arctic_ice_annual)[1]))
{
  arctic_ice_annual$extent_annual_avg[i] = mean(arctic_ice[which(arctic_ice$Year == arctic_ice_annual$Year[i]),'Extent'])
}

# 5-year average:
for (i in seq(3, dim(arctic_ice_annual)[1]-2))
{
  years = c((arctic_ice_annual$Year[i]-2):(arctic_ice_annual$Year[i]+2))
  arctic_ice_annual$extent_5yr_avg[i] = mean(arctic_ice[which(arctic_ice$Year %in% years),'Extent'])
}

pdf('figures/arctic_ice_extent.pdf', width=7, height=5)
plot(extent_annual_avg ~ Year, data=arctic_ice_annual, col="red", type="l") +
  lines(extent_5yr_avg ~ Year, data=arctic_ice_annual, col="blue", type="l")
dev.off()
```

As you'd expect, the 5-year-average really smooths out some of that year-to-year variability and makes it a bit easier to observe the overall trend through time. 

If we want to plot the annual and 5-year averages on the same plot as the original observations, we'll have to change our `Year` variable into a `date`-type variable that will plot nicely along the dates in the original observation dataset:

``` {r}
#To plot the annual and 5-year averages on the same plot as the original observations:
arctic_ice_annual$date = as.Date(paste(arctic_ice_annual$Year, 1, 1, sep = "-"))
plot(Extent ~ date, data=arctic_ice, ylab="Arctic sea ice extent (x10^6 km^2)", type='l') +
  lines(extent_annual_avg ~ date, data=arctic_ice_annual, col="red") +
  lines(extent_5yr_avg ~ date, data=arctic_ice_annual, col="blue")
```

Now, let's calculate the observed rate of change in annually averaged ice extent across the time period by subtracting the first average Arctic ice extent area from the most recent average Arctic ice extent area, and dividing by the number of years of observation:

```{r}
ice_loss_million_km2 = (arctic_ice_annual$extent_annual_avg[dim(arctic_ice_annual)[1]] - arctic_ice_annual$extent_annual_avg[1]) / (max(arctic_ice_annual$Year) - min(arctic_ice_annual$Year))
```
So from 1978 to 2020, we have lost 50,000 km^2 of ice extent in the Arctic. That's about the size of Vermont and New Hampshire combined!
